Completed July, 2021

The goal of this project is to demonstrate ability to develope an Android app utilizing tools such as recycler_view, intents, and context menus. The app is to provide the user with a list of movies, and on a single press the user would be redirected to the movie's trailer. On long press, there will be additional options.
